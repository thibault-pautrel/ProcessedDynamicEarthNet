# üõ∞Ô∏è ProcessedDynamicEarthNet

The goal of this project is to train and evaluate two different models for **pixel-wise semantic segmentation** of Earth observation images:

- **U-Net**: Trained on temporally stacked data (one tensor per month).
- **SPDNet**: Trained on covariance matrices computed from spatio-temporal patches of the data.

Both models aim to predict **land cover classes for each pixel** from satellite imagery.

## üì¶ Download and Prepare the DynamicEarthNet Dataset

1. Download the dataset from the official [DynamicEarthNet GitHub repository](https://github.com/aysim/dynnet).

2. After downloading and extracting the data (e.g., `planet.10N`, `planet.11N`, etc.), use the following scripts to pre-process it:

   - **Step 1**: Convert `.tif` imagery and labels into PyTorch tensors  
     ```bash
     python load_data.py
     ```  
     To display a given image next to its labeled version, run:  
     ```bash
     python inspect_and_display_labels.py
     ```

   - **Step 2 (For U-Net)**: Generate temporally stacked tensors and label maps for each month  
     ```bash
     python month_stacked_labels.py
     ```

   - **Step 3 (For SPDNet)**: Compute pixel-wise covariance matrices and extract labels in blocks  
     ```bash
     python cov_label.py
     ```

## üß† Model Training Pipelines

### 1. U-Net Pipeline
Train a U-Net model using temporally stacked monthly data:  
```bash
python unet_pipeline.py
```

### 2. SPDNet Pipeline
   Train a SPDNet model using block-wise covariance matrices: 
   ```bash
    python spdnet_pipeline.py
   ```

   It requires anotherspdnet library from [AnotherSPDNet repository](https://github.com/AmmarMian/anotherspdnet/tree/main).
   It processes covariance blocks and performs pixel classification.

*Remark*:  Due to variability in the temporal dimension T (28, 30, 31 days), padding is applied where necessary for consistency.
